        <p class="p-profile-pic">
          I am Klaus Schroeder, a dedicated and driven Computer Science student at Quinnipiac University, where I am on track to graduate in May 2025 with a bachelor's degree and in May 2026 with a master's degree in Cyber Security. My journey in the tech world began early, as I graduated cum laude with an associate degree in Web Development from Norwalk Community College in May 2022, just a month before completing high school. This strong academic background has laid the foundation for my passion for programming, software development, and web technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="p-profile-pic">
          My professional experience includes internships with IBM in both the Energy and Resources Division and the Cloud and Cognitive Division, where I was able to apply my technical skills in real-world settings. These experiences not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also honed my ability to work collaboratively in teams, tackle complex problems, and deliver innovative solutions. I pride myself on being an innovative thinker with a solid understanding of technical programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript, and a familiarity with methodologies such as Agile and Scrum.
        </p>
        <p class="p-profile-pic">
          Beyond academics and work, I maintain a balanced and active lifestyle. I enjoy playing basketball, coding personal projects, hitting the gym, and diving into a good book during my free time. These activities not only keep me physically fit but also sharpen my focus, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, which I bring into my academic and professional pursuits.
        </p>
        <p class="p-profile-pic">
          As I look forward to graduating and entering the professional world, I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to make significant contributions in the fields of Computer Science and Cyber Security. I am confident that my strong technical foundation, coupled with my enthusiasm for continuous learning and personal growth, will enable me to excel in any challenging environment.

          <p>This project is a Role Playing Game (RPG) using JavaScript. You'll manage player stats like experience points, health, and gold while navigating through different locations, battling monsters, and upgrading weapons. The game will incorporate arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, and conditional statements, providing a hands-on experience in developing an interactive web-based RPG.</p>

          <p>This project is a multi-player trivia game that can be played over a network, requiring knowledge in concurrency control, socket programming (both TCP and UDP), and GUI event handling. The game features client-server interactions where the server sends trivia questions, and clients respond by buzzing in, with the fastest response allowing the client to answer the question. The server manages multiple clients concurrently, ensuring synchronized communication and maintaining a score tally throughout the game.</p>
